  <p>My favorite thing to make right now is dinosaurs. I have recently discovered that with this pattern that I found for a dinosaur I can dress it and crochet it in a costume when I'm making it. This has been interesting because I have seen a lot of people post online their pictures of stuffed animals with costumes on but I was never really interested in it until I made the little Pikachu dinosaur that you can see below. Making stuffed animals is so much fun. I think it's probably the second best part of crocheting. I think the best part of crocheting would be being able to give the stuffed animals that I make away or to sell them. It is so amazing to see little kids' faces light up when they see what I've made, even full grown adults have their faces light up and they get super excited about the simplest little things. I think the best part of crocheting that I've seen is being able to bring other people joy in this dark and dreary world. I think that making stuffed animals is so important to me because I remember how important stuffed animals were to me when I was little and especially when we didn't have much money or much of anything else. I'm sure in most little kids' memories stuffed animals are very important and I'm sure that the stuffed animals that they have were able to help them create better memories over the years. I hope that when I sell or donate the stuffed animals that I have made, that it can bring others the joy that stuffed animals used to bring me.</p>
