  <p>Have you ever thought about learning how to crochet? Have you ever seen a crochet creation? There are a wide variety of different things that can be made using crochet. You can make stuffed animals, you can make blankets, pillow covers clothes; including dresses, socks, pants, shorts, shirts, sweaters, cardigans, hoodies. You can make washcloths, you can make hats, you can make a wide variety of things, the options are nearly endless. A lot of people think that crocheting and knitting are the same thing, they are very similar and they both produce spectacular products but I am not any good at knitting so my focus has been crocheting over the years. Crochet is a great outlet for creativity. In my mind it is something that I have been able to learn not only to help myself have something to do and for myself to learn and grow, but I have been able to learn it so that I can help other people and I can make things and donate them. I have also tried to make things and sell them but in a world that is so saturated with small businesses it can be hard to sell actual products. The goal of this website is to showcase some of my Creations that I've made over the last year. A little background: I started crocheting when I was younger and I learned probably two stitches and then it was just too hard for a second grader.I crocheted a scarf a few years later and then I didn't touch crocheting for probably another 7 years. Last year I graduated early from high school and so I had 5 months of just work and online college so I decided to work on relearning how to crochet and from there it's just blossomed into something that I can't live without. </p>
