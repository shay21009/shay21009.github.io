  <p>Something else I have been experimenting in is blankets and wearables. I've been seeing a lot of different patterns for different blankets online and in stores. These different patterns have been cool because they help you to pretty much learn a stitch. For most of them it's one stitch for a whole blanket which can be extremely helpful if you struggle with stitches. It helps get your attention all right and it helps get your stitches to be uniform. blankets  are things that everyone can come to love, whether you like blankets that are warm or you like a blankets that make sure you're still cool at night, blankets are a universal thing and everyone has at least once in our lives had a blanket that has just made it so much better to cuddle up in and watch a movie with or a blanket that's just made life a little warmer. I think that making blankets is so important to me because I can donate them and I can help other people to feel the warmth that I am so privileged to have every single day. I also like making sweaters and I'm hoping to experience shirts and hoodies and maybe one day  a dress. I think that these are also important to me because they are still things that I can donate. I have also made scarves and hats, and I'm hoping to make a whole bunch more so that I can donate them. I have made quite a few blankets and I'm having a hard time deciding which ones I want to donate before I go back to college in the fall.
