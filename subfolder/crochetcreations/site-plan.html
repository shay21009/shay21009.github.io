      <p>
        Have you ever thought about learning how to crochet? Have you ever seen a crochet creation? There are a wide variety of different things that can be made using crochet. You can make stuffed animals, you can make blankets, pillow covers clothes; including dresses, socks, pants, shorts, shirts, sweaters, cardigans, hoodies. You can make washcloths, you can make hats, you can make a wide variety of things, the options are nearly endless. A lot of people think that crocheting and knitting are the same thing, they are very similar and they both produce spectacular products but I am not any good at knitting so my focus has been crocheting over the years. Crochet is a great outlet for creativity. In my mind it is something that I have been able to learn not only to help myself have something to do and for myself to learn and grow, but I have been able to learn it so that I can help other people and I can make things and donate them. I have also tried to make things and sell them but in a world that is so saturated with small businesses it can be hard to sell actual products. The goal of this website is to showcase some of my Creations that I've made over the last year. A little background: I started crocheting when I was younger and I learned probably two stitches and then it was just too hard for a second grader.I crocheted a scarf a few years later and then I didn't touch crocheting for probably another 7 years. Last year I graduated early from high school and so I had 5 months of just work and online college so I decided to work on relearning how to crochet and from there it's just blossomed into something that I can't live without.

      <h3>Stuffed Animals </h3>
      <p>
        My favorite thing to make right now is dinosaurs. I have recently discovered that with this pattern that I found for a dinosaur I can dress it and crochet it in a costume when I'm making it. This has been interesting because I have seen a lot of people post online their pictures of stuffed animals with costumes on but I was never really interested in it until I made the little Pikachu dinosaur that you can see below. Making stuffed animals is so much fun. I think it's probably the second best part of crocheting. I think the best part of crocheting would be being able to give the stuffed animals that I make away or to sell them. It is so amazing to see little kids' faces light up when they see what I've made, even full grown adults have their faces light up and they get super excited about the simplest little things. I think the best part of crocheting that I've seen is being able to bring other people joy in this dark and dreary world. I think that making stuffed animals is so important to me because I remember how important stuffed animals were to me when I was little and especially when we didn't have much money or much of anything else. I'm sure in most little kids' memories stuffed animals are very important and I'm sure that the stuffed animals that they have were able to help them create better memories over the years. I hope that when I sell or donate the stuffed animals that I have made, that it can bring others the joy that stuffed animals used to bring me.

      <h3>Blankets and Wearables</h3>
      <p>
        Something else I have been experimenting in is blankets and wearables. I've been seeing a lot of different patterns for different blankets online and in stores. These different patterns have been cool because they help you to pretty much learn a stitch. For most of them it's one stitch for a whole blanket which can be extremely helpful if you struggle with stitches. It helps get your attention all right and it helps get your stitches to be uniform. blankets  are things that everyone can come to love, whether you like blankets that are warm or you like a blankets that make sure you're still cool at night, blankets are a universal thing and everyone has at least once in our lives had a blanket that has just made it so much better to cuddle up in and watch a movie with or a blanket that's just made life a little warmer. I think that making blankets is so important to me because I can donate them and I can help other people to feel the warmth that I am so privileged to have every single day. I also like making sweaters and I'm hoping to experience shirts and hoodies and maybe one day  a dress. I think that these are also important to me because they are still things that I can donate. I have also made scarves and hats, and I'm hoping to make a whole bunch more so that I can donate them. I have made quite a few blankets and I'm having a hard time deciding which ones I want to donate before I go back to college in the fall.
